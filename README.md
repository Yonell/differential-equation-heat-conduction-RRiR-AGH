# differential-equation-heat-conduction-RRiR-AGH
Differential equation calculator for heat conduction made as a project for RRiR course on AGH.

Dependencies:
  - Armadillo library
  - SuperLU (if you want to use sparce matrices)
  - Gnuplot (if you want to show graphs)
Also, for release binaries only gnuplot is necessary.

To use the program on Windows open the folder containing RRiR.exe in a terminal and write for example:
./RRiR -n 200 -g

For all of the options write:
./RRiR -h
